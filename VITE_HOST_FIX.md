# Vite Host Blocking Issue - FIXED ✅

## 🐛 The Problem

When deploying to Render, you encountered this error:

```
Blocked request. This host ("event-management-frontend-7awm.onrender.com") is not allowed.
To allow this host, add "event-management-frontend-7awm.onrender.com" to `preview.allowedHosts` in vite.config.js.
```

## 🔧 The Fix

Updated `vite.config.js` to allow all hosts in the preview configuration:

```javascript
preview: {
  port: parseInt(env.PORT) || 4173,
  host: '0.0.0.0',
  allowedHosts: 'all', // ← Added this line
},
```

## 📝 Why This Happened

Vite's preview server (used in production on Render) has a security feature that blocks requests from unknown hostnames. Render assigns dynamic hostnames like `your-app.onrender.com`, which Vite doesn't recognize by default.

By setting `allowedHosts: 'all'`, we tell Vite to accept requests from any hostname, which is safe for production deployments on trusted platforms like Render.

## 🚀 What You Need to Do

The fix has been committed and pushed to GitHub. Now:

1. **Wait for Render to Redeploy** (automatic)

   - Render detects the new commit
   - Automatically rebuilds and redeploys your frontend
   - Takes ~5-8 minutes

2. **Or Trigger Manual Deploy** (faster)

   - Go to your frontend service on Render
   - Click **"Manual Deploy"** → **"Deploy latest commit"**
   - Wait for build to complete

3. **Clear Browser Cache**

   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
   - Or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - This ensures you're loading the latest version

4. **Test Again**
   - Visit: `https://event-management-frontend-7awm.onrender.com`
   - Should now load without the error!

## ✅ Verification

Your frontend should now:

- ✅ Load without "host not allowed" error
- ✅ Show the login page
- ✅ Connect to the backend API
- ✅ Allow user registration and login

## 📚 Additional Notes

- This is a **one-time fix** - you won't need to configure this again
- The setting is safe for production on Render
- Local development (`npm run dev`) is unaffected
- Works with any Render URL (including custom domains)

## 🔄 Alternative Solutions

If you prefer more restrictive security, you could:

```javascript
preview: {
  allowedHosts: [
    'event-management-frontend-7awm.onrender.com',
    'your-custom-domain.com',
  ];
}
```

But `'all'` is simpler and works for Render's dynamic URLs.

**Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed! Wait for Render to rebuild, then refresh your browser.
