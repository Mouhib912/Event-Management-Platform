# 🔧 Render Redeploy Instructions

## ⚠️ Issue

You're still seeing the "host not allowed" error even though the fix is in the code. This means Render hasn't rebuilt your frontend yet.

## ✅ Solution: Force a Redeploy

### **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**

   - Visit: https://dashboard.render.com
   - Login to your account

2. **Find Your Frontend Service**

   - Look for: `event-management-frontend`
   - Or the service at: `event-management-frontend-7awm.onrender.com`
   - Click on it to open

3. **Trigger Manual Deploy**

   - Look for the **"Manual Deploy"** button (usually top right)
   - Click it
   - Select **"Clear build cache & deploy"** (recommended)
   - OR select **"Deploy latest commit"**

4. **Wait for Build**

   - Watch the logs as it builds
   - Build typically takes 5-8 minutes
   - Look for messages like:
     ```
     Building...
     npm install
     npm run build
     Starting server...
     ```

5. **Verify Deployment**
   - Once "Live" status shows green
   - Visit: https://event-management-frontend-7awm.onrender.com
   - **Clear your browser cache**: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - You should see the login page without errors!

## 🎯 What's Happening

- ✅ The fix (`allowedHosts: 'all'`) is already in `vite.config.js`
- ✅ The code has been pushed to GitHub
- ✅ I just triggered a rebuild by pushing an empty commit
- ⏳ Render is now detecting the change and will rebuild automatically
- ⏳ Wait 5-8 minutes, then refresh your browser

---

## 🔍 How to Check Build Status

### In Render Dashboard:

1. Click on your frontend service
2. Go to **"Events"** tab to see deployment history
3. Go to **"Logs"** tab to watch real-time build logs
4. Look for:
   - ✅ "Build succeeded"
   - ✅ "Deploy live"
   - ❌ "Build failed" (if this happens, check logs for errors)

### Expected Log Output:

```
==> Cloning from https://github.com/Mouhib912/Event-Management-Platform...
==> Checking out commit 7133b889
==> Running build command 'npm install && npm run build'
==> Installing dependencies...
==> Building application...
==> Build succeeded!
==> Starting server with: npm run preview -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
==> Your service is live!
```

## ⏱️ Timeline

- **Right Now**: Render detected the new commit (7133b889)
- **+2 minutes**: Build starts
- **+5-8 minutes**: Build completes, service goes live
- **Then**: Refresh your browser and test!

---

## 🧪 After Deployment, Test:

1. **Clear Browser Cache** (important!)

   - Chrome/Edge: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Firefox: `Ctrl + F5`
   - Safari: `Cmd + Option + R`

2. **Visit Frontend**

   - URL: https://event-management-frontend-7awm.onrender.com
   - Should load without errors

3. **Check Console**

   - Press `F12` to open DevTools
   - Go to Console tab
   - Should see no 403 errors
   - Should see successful API calls

4. **Try Login/Register**
   - Test basic functionality
   - Verify backend connection works

---

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

1. **Verify Build Completed**

   - Check Render dashboard shows "Live" status
   - Verify latest commit hash matches (7133b889)

2. **Check Render Logs**

   - Look for "allowedHosts" in the server startup
   - Ensure no build errors

3. **Hard Refresh Browser**

   - Close all tabs with your app
   - Clear browser cache completely
   - Open in incognito/private window

4. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Go to frontend service → Environment tab
   - Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly

## 💡 Pro Tip
