# 🎯 Executive Summary - Platform Restructure

## What You're Building

You're transforming this from a **Booth Rental Tool** into a **comprehensive ERP/CRM Platform** for event management businesses, with booth maker as a specialized addon module.

---

## 💡 The Core Insight

> **"A contact can be BOTH a client (we sell to them) AND a fournisseur (we buy from them)"**

This is the key realization that drives the entire restructure. Instead of maintaining separate, duplicated lists of Clients and Suppliers, you have ONE unified **Contacts** list where each contact can play multiple roles.

---

## 🎯 Three Main Modules

### 1️⃣ **ACHATS** (Purchases) - 📥
**What:** Track everything you BUY from your fournisseurs
- Create purchase orders (Bon de Commande)
- Manage products you've purchased
- Track deliveries and payments
- Maintain supplier relationships

**Example:** You buy furniture from "Company C" to use in your booths

---

### 2️⃣ **VENTES** (Sales) - 📤  
**What:** Track everything you SELL to your clients
- Generate invoices and quotes (Devis)
- Manage customer orders
- Track payments received
- Maintain client relationships

**Example:** You rent booths to "Company A" for their exhibition

---

### 3️⃣ **BOOTH MAKER** (Addon) - 🎪
**What:** Specialized tool for creating exhibition stands
- Select products (from your inventory)
- Configure stand layouts
- Generate quotes for booth rentals
- Visual simulator

**Key Feature:** Only shows products relevant to booth creation (furniture, lighting, displays) - NOT office supplies, internet services, etc.

---

## 🔄 The Unified Contact Example

```
Company A
├─ Type: BOTH (Client & Fournisseur)
│
├─ AS CLIENT (we sell to them):
│  └─ Rented 3 booths this year
│     Total revenue: 15,000 TND
│
└─ AS FOURNISSEUR (we buy from them):
   └─ Purchased IT services & software
      Total spent: 3,500 TND

NET RELATIONSHIP: +11,500 TND profit ✅
```

This would require TWO separate entries in the old system. Now it's ONE contact with full relationship history!

---

## 🎛️ The Settings Control

**Problem:** You buy many types of products, but not all are relevant for booth creation.

**Solution:** Settings page where you toggle which categories appear in Booth Maker:

```
✅ Mobilier          → YES, used in booths
✅ Éclairage         → YES, used in booths
✅ Décoration        → YES, used in booths
❌ Internet          → NO, not needed for booth layout
❌ Office Supplies   → NO, internal use only
❌ Services IT       → NO, not physical booth items
```

Result: Clean, focused booth creation tool that only shows relevant products.

## 📊 New Navigation Logic

### Old Way (Booth-Centric)
```
Everything mixed together, booth tools scattered throughout menu
```

### New Way (Business Logic)
```
📥 ACHATS
   ↓
   What we BUY
   ↓
   Bons de Commande + Produits

📤 VENTES  
   ↓
   What we SELL
   ↓
   Factures + Devis

🎪 BOOTH MAKER
   ↓
   Specialized tool
   ↓
   Créer Stand + Catalogue + Simulateur
```

**Benefit:** Clear separation of business functions. Each module has a specific purpose.
